# Here the instructions define your application as a service called "server".
# This service is built from the Dockerfile in the current directory.
# You can add other 3_services your application may depend on here, such as a
# database or a cache. For examples, see the Awesome Compose repository:
# https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose

    # --- WATCH CONFIGURATION START ---
    develop:
      watch:
        # Watch the entire context directory.
        # This is a common setup for development where you want changes in your source code
        # to trigger a rebuild or restart.
        - path: .
          action: rebuild # Or 'sync' depending on your specific needs

        # Example of watching specific files or directories and triggering a specific command
        # if your build process is more granular or you want to run tests on changes.
        # You might not need this if 'rebuild' on the whole context is sufficient.
        # - path: ./src
        #   target: /app/src # Where it goes inside the container
        #   action: sync

        # If your Node.js application uses a tool like nodemon, you might configure watch
        # to restart the service on changes.
        # In this case, you might not use 'rebuild' directly for every change,
        # but instead let nodemon handle it internally after a 'sync'.
        # For this to work, your Dockerfile or entrypoint would need to run nodemon.
        # Example:
        # - path: .
        #   action: rebuild
        #   # This 'watch' entry itself doesn't directly restart the running app within the container.
        #   # It dictates what `docker compose watch` does.
        #   # If you want to automatically restart your Node.js app inside the container on file changes,
        #   # ensure your server's startup command (in Dockerfile or entrypoint) uses something like `nodemon`.
